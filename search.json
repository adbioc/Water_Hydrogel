    "text": "The idea of a quantitative hydrogel based water retentivity monitoring arose from a lab discussion (held on 21st Oct 2022) on IoT based water monitoring system. Some key questions cropped up in the discussion were, while we are able to measure the “wetness” of a given surface, can we measure the water retentivity in a hydrogel, or, more correctly, retentivity assisted by hydrogel embedded in a substrate (like soil). The discussion took another turn when we asked ourselves whether we can extrapolate this method to quality-check a given sample of hydrogel. Since, surface area are important aspects of hydrogel based water retention, an associated question that cropped up was,how increasing surface area of hydrogels, by lowering their hydrodynamical radii to micron or, nano-scale, would improve their water retention capacity? The next obvious question that was also discussed was about the recycling of hydrogels and possible intactness of their water-rention activity.\nThe present write-up is about the following:\n\nCan we develop a small project on thie topic?\nCan we test the\n\nlab scale feasibility?\nscalability of the project?\nnovelty of the core concept?"

    "text": "One important factor of plant growth in water limited agrozones is resolved by adding hydrogels Montesano et al. (2015),El-Asmar et al. (2017). There have also been keen interest in soil water retention in presence of hydrogel Narjary et al. (2012),Abedi-Koupai, Sohrab, and Swarbrick (2008). Its prepartion detail is provided in some recent reviews e.g., Ahmed (2015). Some research related to hydrogel particle size on its water retention activity has also been cited Abdallah (2019)."

We can express the power law by: \\[\\begin{equation}\nM_t/M_\\infty = kt^n\n\\label{eq:powerlaw}\n\\end{equation}\\]\nwhere \\(M_t\\) is the mass of water gained or lost at time t, \\(N_\\infty\\) is the initial mass of water contained in the hydrogel, k is a constant and n is the diffusion exponent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nUsually the mechanism of the water transport in the hydrogels may be characterized by the diffusion exponent n in the power law model.The two cases n = 0.5 and n = 1 are important. When n = 0.5, the water transport is controlled exclusively by the chemical potential gradient, little or no volume variation occurs during the transport\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbdallah, Ahmad M. 2019. “The Effect of Hydrogel Particle Size on Water Retention Properties and Availability Under Water Stress.” International Soil and Water Conservation Research 7 (3): 275–85.\n\n\nAbedi-Koupai, Jahangir, Farahnaz Sohrab, and Gareth Swarbrick. 2008. “Evaluation of Hydrogel Application on Soil Water Retention Characteristics.” Journal of Plant Nutrition 31 (2): 317–31.\n\n\nAhmed, Enas M. 2015. “Hydrogel: Preparation, Characterization, and Applications: A Review.” Journal of Advanced Research 6 (2): 105–21.\n\n\nEl-Asmar, Jessica, Hadi Jaafar, Issam Bashour, Mohammad T Farran, and Imad P Saoud. 2017. “Hydrogel Banding Improves Plant Growth, Survival, and Water Use Efficiency in Two Calcareous Soils.” CLEAN–Soil, Air, Water 45 (7): 1700251.\n\n\nMontesano, Francesco F, Angelo Parente, Pietro Santamaria, Alessandro Sannino, and Francesco Serio. 2015. “Biodegradable Superabsorbent Hydrogel Increaseswater Retention Properties of Growing Media and Plant Growth.” Agriculture and Agricultural Science Procedia 4: 451–58.\n\n\nNarjary, Bhaskar, Pramila Aggarwal, Anupama Singh, Debashis Chakraborty, and Ravender Singh. 2012. “Water Availability in Different Soils in Relation to Hydrogel Application.” Geoderma 187: 94–101."
